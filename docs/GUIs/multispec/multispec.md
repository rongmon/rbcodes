## Usage

MultispecViewer can be run from the command line using:

```bash
python /path/to/rbcodes/GUIs/multispecviewer/rb_multispec.py
```

For convenience, you can create an alias:

```bash
alias multispec='python /path/to/rbcodes/GUIs/multispecviewer/rb_multispec.py'
```

Then simply run:

```bash
multispec
```

### Command Line Options

```
usage: rb_multispec.py [-h] [-c] [-v] [-e] [filenames [filenames ...]]

rb_multispec - A tool for visualizing spectral data

positional arguments:
  filenames          FITS files to load automatically on startup

```

## Features

### Interface

The MultispecViewer interface consists of several components:

- A toolbar for selecting FITS files and clearing displayed lines
- A main plotting area for displaying spectra
- A redshift input panel for applying and cataloging redshifts
- A message box for displaying status information
- An absorber manager for cataloging multiple systems (new version only)
- Action buttons for loading, saving, and displaying identified lines

### Loading Data

You can load data in two ways:

1. **Command Line**: Specify FITS files when launching the application:
   ```bash
   multispec file1.fits file2.fits
   ```

2. **GUI**: Click the "Select FITS Files" button, then navigate to and select one or more FITS format spectral files.

The spectra will be loaded and displayed in the main plotting area.

## Complete Workflow Examples

### Identifying and Cataloging an Absorber

Here's a typical workflow for identifying and cataloging an absorber:

1. **Load spectral data**:
   - Use command line: `multispec file1.fits file2.fits`
   - Or click "Select FITS Files" and choose your FITS files
   - The spectra will be displayed in the main window


2. **Initial redshift identification**:
   - Right-click on a spectral feature
   - Select a possible line from the dialog to calculate the implied redshift
   - The redshift will be applied to the redshift input widget


3. **Apply redshift and check for additional lines**:
   - Verify the selected line list in the redshift widget
   - Choose a color for the lines
   - Click "Submit" to mark all lines at that redshift
   - Visually inspect the marked lines to confirm the identification


4. **Detailed analysis with vStack**:
   - Position your cursor on the spectrum and press `v` for default velocity windows or `V` to set custom velocity limits
   - Navigate through pages of lines using `<` and `>` keys
   - Mark each line as Detection, Non-Detection, Blended, or Low-Confidence using the `w` key
   - Press `S` to save all marked lines and return to the main display


5. **Catalog the absorber system**:
   - Click "Catalog" to add the current redshift system to the absorber manager
   - The absorber will appear in the left panel with its redshift, line list, and color
   - Use the checkbox to toggle visibility of the system


6. **Save your work**:
   - Click the "Save" button to save your line identifications and absorber systems
   - Choose a filename and format (JSON recommended for complete data)
   - Add optional metadata when prompted


### Identifying Multiple Systems

To identify multiple absorber systems:

1. Follow the workflow above to identify your first system
2. After cataloging the first system, clear the current redshift markings by pressing `R`
3. Identify a feature from a different system using right-click or direct redshift input
4. Apply a different color to distinguish the second system from the first
5. Confirm the identification and add it to the catalog
6. Repeat for additional systems


### Managing Line Identifications

After identifying multiple systems:

1. Click the "List" button to view all identified lines in a tabular format
2. Use the "Show" button to toggle the visibility of all identified lines
3. Use the absorber manager checkboxes to control which systems are displayed
4. Click the "Save" button to save all identifications

## Reconciling Line Identifications from Multiple Sessions

MultispecViewer includes a utility function for reconciling line identifications from multiple saved files. This is particularly useful when combining line catalogs from different observers or analysis sessions.

### Using the Line Reconciliation Tool

You can use the line reconciliation tool directly in Python script outside the GUI:

```python
from rbcodes.GUIs.multispecviewer.utils import reconcile_linelists

# Combine line identifications from multiple files
input_files = [
    '/path/to/session1_lines.json',
    '/path/to/session2_lines.txt',
    '/path/to/session3_lines.csv'
]

# Reconcile lines that have the same name and are within 20 km/s of each other
reconciled_lines, absorber_systems = reconcile_linelists(
    input_files,
    velocity_threshold=20,                 # Velocity difference threshold in km/s
    output_file='combined_catalog.json',   # Output file (optional)
    create_absorber_df=True                # Create absorber systems DataFrame
)

print(f"Combined {len(input_files)} files into {len(reconciled_lines)} unique line identifications")
print(f"Identified {len(absorber_systems)} distinct absorber systems")
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Command Line Usage

- Use wildcards to load multiple files: `multispec *.fits`
- For files with spaces in names, use quotes: `multispec "My Data/file.fits"`
- Run classic mode with files: `multispec -c file1.fits file2.fits`
- View detailed examples: `multispec --examples`

### Keyboard Navigation

- Use the keyboard navigation keys (`x`, `X`, `t`, `b`) for precise control of the display
- Press `r` to reset to the original view if you get lost
- Use `R` to clear line identifications without changing the view
- Press `H` at any time to see the help window with keyboard shortcuts

### Redshift Identification

- Start by identifying strong, unambiguous features like MgII, CIV, or Lyman-alpha
- Use right-click to see all possible line identifications at a given wavelength
- After applying a redshift, check for other expected lines at the same redshift
- If uncertain about a feature, use vStack (`v` or `V`) for detailed analysis

### vStack Analysis

- Use `V` to specify custom velocity limits for better visualizing line profiles
- Mark line detections systematically using the `w` key
- Don't forget to press `S` to save your work before returning to the main display
- Use `Y` to adjust y-limits for better visualization of line profiles

### Multiple Absorber Systems

- Use different colors for different absorber systems
- Use the absorber manager to toggle visibility of systems when the display gets crowded
- Use the "Clear All Lines" button to remove all line identifications at once
- Save your work frequently using the "Save" button

### File Management

- Use JSON format for complete data preservation (includes all metadata)
- CSV and TXT formats are available for compatibility with other tools
- When loading data, you can choose to append to or overwrite existing data
- Use consistent file naming conventions for your saved data

## Version Information

MultispecViewer follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- MAJOR version changes indicate incompatible API changes
- MINOR version changes add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- PATCH version changes make backward-compatible bug fixes

You can check the current version by running:

```bash
multispec --version
```

## Development

MultispecViewer is part of the rbcodes package for spectroscopic analysis. It utilizes:
- PyQt5 for the graphical interface
- Matplotlib for plotting
- linetools for spectral data handling
- astropy for astronomical calculations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No files selected**: Ensure you've clicked "Select FITS Files" and chosen valid FITS files or specified files on the command line
- **No error spectrum**: If no error spectrum is found, the program will assume 5% of flux values
- **No lines visible after applying redshift**: Check that the selected line list contains lines within your wavelength range
- **vStack not launching**: Ensure you have a redshift and line list selected before pressing `v` or `V`

### Error Messages

Watch the message box at the bottom of the screen for helpful error messages and status updates.

### Getting Help

Press `H` at any time to open the help dialog with keyboard shortcuts and quick reference information.
